                <h4>1. Whitehaven Beach, Queensland</h4>
                <p>Whitehaven Beach is a pristine, award winning beach on Whitsunday Island, the largest of the 74
                    islands in the Whitsundays. Whitehaven Beach stretches over seven kilometres and boasts brilliant
                    white silica sand that is among the purest in the world. Sink your feet into the sand and wade into
                    the warm waves that gently lap the shore and you'll soon realise why people come here from all over
                    the world.</p>

                <h4>2. Lucky Bay, Western Australia</h4>
                <p>About 70 kilometers from Twilight Beach in Cape le Grand National Park, Lucky Bay is another one of
                    Australia's whitest stretches of sand. Anyone would be lucky to find themselves in the embrace of
                    this dazzling crescent-shaped bay. Wildlife lovers will also be in heaven here – Kangaroos often
                    lounge on its shores, posing for quintessential Aussie photo ops.</p>

                    waters and a fringe of national park completing the picture. Uncover scenic coastal walks, meet
                    native wildlife and explore the glittering ocean in this small village in the Shoalhaven region of

                <p>Tasmania's most famous beach forms a perfect white curve beneath the Hazards mountains, and is far
                    and away the park’s most popular – and photogenic - natural feature.</p>

                <h4>5. Vivonne Bay, South Australia</h4>
                <p>Vivonne Bay, on Kangaroo Island in South Australia, is an unspoiled stretch of bright, white sand and
                    azure sea. You can sometimes spot seals bobbing in the cool, clear water here.The waves here are
                    often perfect for surfing and boogie boarding, but you need to take care, as the beach is not
                    patrolled. Swimming is best in the summer, when the water warms up.</p>

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### Installation options

**Option one:** One-click deploy

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/netlify-templates/next-netlify-starter&utm_source=github&utm_medium=nextstarter-cs&utm_campaign=devex-cs)

**Option two:** Manual clone

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/netlify-templates/next-netlify-starter.git`
2. Navigate to the directory and run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Make your changes
5. Connect to [Netlify](https://url.netlify.com/Bk4UicocL) manually (the `netlify.toml` file is the one you'll need to make sure stays intact to make sure the export is done and pointed to the right stuff)

## Testing

### Included Default Testing

We’ve included some tooling that helps us maintain these templates. This template currently uses:

- [Renovate](https://www.mend.io/free-developer-tools/renovate/) - to regularly update our dependencies
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) - to run tests against how the template runs in the browser
- [Cypress Netlify Build Plugin](https://github.com/cypress-io/netlify-plugin-cypress) - to run our tests during our build process

If your team is not interested in this tooling, you can remove them with ease!

### Removing Renovate

In order to keep our project up-to-date with dependencies we use a tool called [Renovate](https://github.com/marketplace/renovate). If you’re not interested in this tooling, delete the `renovate.json` file and commit that onto your main branch.

### Removing Cypress

For our testing, we use [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for end-to-end testing. This makes sure that we can validate that our templates are rendering and displaying as we’d expect. By default, we have Cypress not generate deploy links if our tests don’t pass. If you’d like to keep Cypress and still generate the deploy links, go into your `netlify.toml` and delete the plugin configuration lines:

```diff
[[plugins]]
  package = "netlify-plugin-cypress"
-  [plugins.inputs.postBuild]
-    enable = true
-
-  [plugins.inputs]
-    enable = false 
```

If you’d like to remove the `netlify-plugin-cypress` build plugin entirely, you’d need to delete the entire block above instead. And then make sure sure to remove the package from the dependencies using:

```bash
npm uninstall -D netlify-plugin-cypress
```

And lastly if you’d like to remove Cypress entirely, delete the entire `cypress` folder and the `cypress.config.ts` file. Then remove the dependency using:

```bash
npm
